# Text-classification

This is a simple impementation of text classification using scikit-learn

I initially used the dataset [BBC Full Text Document Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alfathterry/bbc-full-text-document-classification) by Kaggle

Later I also tried the dataset [Ecommerce Text Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/ecommerce-text-classification) by Kaggle, which I did not push, because of space, but you can still see the access in the jupyter notebook
